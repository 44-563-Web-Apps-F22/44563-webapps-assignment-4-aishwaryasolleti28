     FIA.           Are only two.

     CHORUS.        They, alas, are only two, alas!
                    Now ye know, ye dainty roses,
                    Roses white and roses red,
                    Why we bind you into posies,
                         Ere your morning bloom has fled,
                         Roses white and roses red!
    
     FRANC.    Good morrow, pretty maids; for whom prepare ye
            These floral tributes extraordinary?

     FIA.      For Marco and Giuseppe Palmieri,
            The pink and flower of all the Gondolieri.

     GIU.      They're coming here, as we have heard but lately,
            To choose two brides from us who sit sedately.

     ANT.      Do all you maidens love them?

     VIT.      In the meantime we tacitly ignore you.

     MAR.           And now to choose our brides!

     GIU.                As all are young and fair,
                       And amiable besides,

     BOTH.               We really do not care
                           A preference to declare.
